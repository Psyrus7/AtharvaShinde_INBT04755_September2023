THIS PROJECT IS STRICTLY MADE FOR INTERNSHIP @ "iNeuBytes".
This README provides an overview and step-by-step guide to using two different models, VGG16 (Transfer Learning Model) and Custom CNN, for the CIFAR-10 image classification task. 
These models are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## VGG16 Transfer Learning Model

### Usage
- Transfer learning using the VGG16 model.
- Code for loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, data preprocessing, and model training.
- Achieves a test accuracy of approximately 71.79%.

### Code
- The code for the VGG16 Transfer Learning Model can be found in the https://github.com/Psyrus7/AtharvaShinde_INBT04755_September2023.git

## Custom CNN Model

### Usage
- A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for image classification.
- Code for loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, data preprocessing, and model training.
- Achieves a test accuracy of approximately 69.84%.

### Code

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
 https://github.com/Psyrus7/AtharvaShinde_INBT04755_September2023.git
   ```bash
 https://github.com/Psyrus7/AtharvaShinde_INBT04755_September2023.git

  

Navigate to the desired model's directory (e.g., vgg16 or custom_cnn).

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in your Jupyter environment.

Run the code step by step to load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Please note that training these models may take a considerable amount of time, especially the VGG16 model if you choose to train on the entire dataset. You can adjust the number of training epochs and dataset size to reduce training time.
